A friend of mine dragged me into something weird and I tried to do it in a weirdest possible way. I didn't succeed though.   
Seems like it was some kind of Capture th Flag game where you had to connect via netcat to a remote server that gives you several seconds to calculate a number in hex and it's impossible to do by hand (duh). So I decided to write this monstrosisty that would get an image and read the number. I wanted it to read it, convert and send back to terminal. Too bad I stumbled at the point where it has to convert it. Lol.   
The program does a screenshot of an area on the screen:

(Yes, it's hardcoded, I know I'm retared)   
And after that it prints the numbers:

Thanks for the attention.
